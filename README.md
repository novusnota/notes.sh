## üêß About

Super-simple small bash (shell) script with zero dependencies,
which manages notes with ease and grace of a terminal.

Create a dated text file at a specific location and append text to it. It's that simple!

Works literally on every Linux-like system. And probably should work on MacOS.
If not, please open an [issue](https://github.com/novusnota/notes.sh/issues).

###### NOTE (unintended pun):

Some features, such as: custom note creation template
or dynamic folder resolution rely on git installed
and on a .git folder inside of this repo.

## ü§ü Getting Started

#### 1. Download the script

Using curl:

```bash
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/novusnota/notes.sh/master/notes.sh
```

Or grab it from the latest [Release](https://github.com/novusnota/notes.sh/releases/latest)

#### 2. Installing

There are at least two ways:

1. Just place it somewhere and add an alias

Example:

```bash
alias note='path/to/somewhere/with/notes.sh'
```

2. Create a symbolic link somewhere on your PATH.

Examples:

```
# If you have a ~/.local/bin on your PATH
ln -s /path/to/somewhere/with/notes.sh ~/.local/bin/note

# Preferred way, would work on pretty much every Linux
sudo ln -s /path/to/somewhere/with/notes.sh /usr/local/sbin/note

# MacOS way:
## don't know much, but the principle is the same:
## get to know your PATH and create a link to notes.sh
## somewhere in that folders
##
## To print out PATH use:
echo $PATH | tr : '\n'
```

## üßê Usage

Append that text to the today's file:

```bash
note something you want to write down
```

Append your clipboard to the file:

```bash
# If you use xsel
xsel -bo | note

# If you use xclip
xclip -o | note

# If you use pbpaste (MacOS)
pbpaste | note
```

Open the file in your editor:

```bash
note
```

Append rather big text to the file:

```bash
# using cat <<EOF trick,
# don't forget to add
# EOF
# on the last line to stop
cat <<EOF | note

# or using backslash escapes - \
note \
    blah blah \
    more blah blah \
    the end. bye-bye\!
# note (xD), that tabs are not required.
# also keep in mind, that Bash handles args before they get into the script
# and some characters like !@`#\ should be escaped, and some '" should match their pairs.
#
# to escape a character, append a backwards slash before it like so:
# \!
```

Either way command creates a file called DD.md
in the $C\_NOTES\_DIR/YYYY/MM. If the file exists, notes.sh will append to it.

Destination folder, filename and other things can be changed using a configuration file, see Customization below.

## üîß Customization

Set the variables of config.sh to your liking.

For your ease of use, there is already an config.example.sh ‚Äî
just rename it to config.sh and you're good to go!

#### Variables

- C\_NOTES\_DIR (/path/to/notes/directory) ‚Äî Top-level directory for all the notes

- C\_NOTES\_EDITOR (nvim, nano, sublime, whatever) ‚Äî Use an editor to change today's note file manually

- C\_NOTES\_DELIMITER (\n---\n, for example) Delimiter between the separated notes inside today's note file

- C\_NOTES\_Y\_SUBDIR (true/false) ‚Äî Create a %Year% subfolder for the notes?

- C\_NOTES\_M\_SUBDIR (true/false) ‚Äî Create a %Month% subfolder for the notes?

- C\_NOTES\_FORMAT (txt, md, whatever) ‚Äî File extension (what goes after the . (dot) in the filenames)

- C\_NOTES\_TEMPLATE (/path/to/file) ‚Äî A template for the new notes
